<h1>Week 11 Recap</h1>
 
<p>We have a very special treat this week. Famed sports columnist Michael Sakoda is appearing as a guest writer on our humble publication. As a taco himself, he took on the recap between the other two tacos Fuki and Lee. And of course, his own match up with the Jono, who clinched the first playoff spot this week. Overall, a lower scoring week where all the favorites won except for yours truly. Capped off with a wild MNF game that ended up being the 3rd highest scoring game of all time. Let's see how that affected the matchups.</p>

<p><i>Playoff rankings will likely shake out in the next week or two. So ease of schedule will be very important from here on out. I'll include a small blurb about each person's ROS schedule in the recaps.</i></p>


<h2>Guest Recaps by Sak</h2>
<p><b>Fuki (4-7) 113.28 vs Lee (3-8) 97.88</b></p>
Billionaire tycoon, Lee, has oft been criticized for his decisions as owner of The Big Gronkowski, and perhaps those cries for his removal from the front office will be even louder after his Week 11 loss to Goulden Showers. Lee’s tight end, kicker, and defense all hail from New England, a team that enjoyed a Week 11 bye, but The Big Gronkowski took off his Tide-cleaned shirt and said, “Fuck it; let it ride,” and sent out six players to face down the Adam Thielen led Goulden Showers.

<p>Unsurprisingly, the bold strategy failed to pay dividends, and Goulden Showers cruised to a 113.28-97.88 victory, improving to 4-7 on the season, while handing The Big Gronkowski their 8th loss of a disappointing season. Interestingly, TBG had a shot to win this one, leaving TY Hilton, who put up 32 points on their bench, literally ten times more than Sterling Shepard, TBG’s starting WR2. Had Lee thought to bench Shepard, the fans could be momentarily appeased.</p>

<p>Regardless of the loss for The Big Gronkowski, or the win for Goulden Showers, this will be a season to forget for both storied franchises. Goulden Showers missed with the number one overall pick, drafting Le’veon Bell, who will not play this season, while TBG took their patron saint, Rob Gronkowski, in the third round. Both teams will look to disrupt the playoff race, though, there is still hope for Goulden Showers, who despite being 4-7, have put up more points than all but two teams in the league, and have an outside shot to make the playoffs should the run the table--New York Giants style, baby. But unfortunately, they’ve run into teams that have put up a ton of points when they probably shouldn’t have; although, wasn’t that the point of that movie, Any Given Sunday? That on any given Sunday, any team could beat another? Something like that. All I really remember is that I saw Al Pacino’s nut sack, and it was unpleasant. </p>
<p><i>Mat: Fuki has Brent, Mike, and Jono left, he should be able to pull out 2 wins there, but that won't be enough to get him into the playoffs. Beating Jono will be key for him.<br/>
  Lee has Dylan, Brent, and Mike, pretty cake schedule but I think Lee has borderline thrown in the towel at this point.

<p><b>Sak (3-8) 102.08 vs Jono (9-2) 120.12</b></p>
<p>Commissioner Chung and 2 Gurleys 1 Cup who have been attempting to quash conspiracy rumors all season, roll to a 120.12-102.08 win over the questionably named Full Chubb. In the wake of two off seasons for Chung, he happens into the second overall pick in the draft, and close personal friend, Brian Fukayama, who received the number one overall pick, “happens” to draft a running back who will not  step onto an NFL field in 2018. Coincidence? The league didn’t think so, and they reacted. </p>

<p>Chung, who declined to comment on the speculation surrounding the sudden success of his franchise, recently announced that there would be a trophy for the winning team. “Seems hella suspect to me,” said Michael Sakoda, manager of Full Chubb, essentially the Oakland Raiders of this season. “Reminiscent of David Stern declaring Key Arena ‘unfit’ for an NBA franchise and forcing a sell of the Seattle Supersonics to his friend, Clay Bennett, for just $350 million, then said that if the Kings moved to Seattle, they could play at Key Arena.” It should be noted that Sakoda, whose team is an abysmal 3-8 on the season, claims to manage “other” fantasy teams that are “doing well.” This reporter, while open to the possibility of a Chung-led conspiracy, isn’t going to take it on the word of a disgruntled owner with a history of telling tall tales. So I decided to reach out to other owners around the league to get their take.</p>

<p>“What?” said Justin Wong, manager of Ambassadors of Quon, while Mat Kwok, manager of Chubb Dysfunction, said in a text message, “Valid concern.” </p>

<p>The certainly does seem to be something fishy going on in the Scrambo league. Chung faces a tough test in Week 12 when they face the 8-3 Ambassadors of Quon, without Todd Gurley. Full Chubb will undoubtedly lose to the poorly named High Quality H2O in Week 12, dropping to 3-9, amid mounting concerns over what the “fun little thing for last place” is.</p>
<p><i>Mat: Jono has Justin, Mat, then Fuki rest of season. Ouch. The 3 highest scoring teams possible for him to face. It's a good thing he's already locked in his playoff spot<br/>
Sak has Brad, Dylan, and Justin. Medium difficulty. Spoiling Brad's playoff chances is the best he can hope for.

<h2>Recaps</h2>

<p><b>Mat (7-4) 113.72 vs Brent (5-6) 131.04</b></p>
In the only upset victory of the week, I lose to Brent behind strong showings from Kareem Hunt, Alvin Kamara, and Aaron Jones. Brent has more elite RBs than he knows what to do with at this point. He still had Mark Ingram on the bench with 22 points. Kenny Golloday is shaping up to be Babytron and a true WR 1 on the Lions. His biggest weakness at this point is the need to start Amari Cooper at WR2. He does have Emmanuel Sanders and Courtland Sutton both on the bench. He'll have to decide on a weekly basis between 2 Denver receivers and Amari. A bit like choosing what kind of car to get hit by. My guys put up a good fight, with most of my studs still putting up studly numbers. But a surprising 7 points from James Conner in a 20 point victory and a goose egg from Ebron ensured my loss. Tom Brady you're my only hope.
<p><i>I have Mike, Jono, and Brad left. I better beat Mike or I could lose my playoff spot last minute.<br/>
  Brent has Fuki, Lee, and Dylan. If he can get past Fuki, he has a good chance of sneaking into the playoffs.
  </i></p>

<p><b>Brad (7-4) 104.82 vs Dylan (5-6) 56.94</b></p>
When Dylan loses he loses in style. He's on the losing end of the biggest blow out of the week with a whooping 56 points. Which is also his record right now at 5-6. Scoring 56 in a 10 man league is actually impressive. Even worse, the feat was accomplished mostly by Dylan's favorite team, the Eagles. The defending champs are looking like a hot mess this year. Carson Wentz put up 156 yards with 3 INT for almost 4 points while Ertz stumbled his way to 2.5 points. Dylan also started Marvin Jones Jr who was out with a knee injury this week, but it's not like there was anyone else on his bench who would have helped. Phillip Lindsay and DeAndre Hopkins are the only bright spots remaining on his roster. Brad cruises to a win with a mediocre point total. Drews and Zeke are their usual bad self and Stefon Diggs lit it up providing 47% of the Viking's total yards. Demaryius Thomas has lost most of his value since his trade to Houston. Deshaun Watson threw for 200 yards with exactly zero of it going to Thomas. Brad will look to Jarvis Landry and Julian Edelman to close out his season at WR.
<p><i>Brad has Sak, Justin, and Me. Ouch, whats the opposite of Cake? Pie? That's a pie schedule.<br/>
  Dylan has Lee, Sak, and Brent. I'd say he has a pretty even chance each of those weeks. Don't let us down.
  </i></p>

<p><b>Justin (8-3) 166.12 vs Mike (4-7) 117.94</b></p>
Justin put up big points again this week. He was a big beneficiary of the monster game on Monday night. With Tyreek, Kelce, and Goff combining for almost 100 points. That was on top of a monster game that Saquon had. 166.12 is the second highest score of the season, behind only to the 177.88 that he scored in week 2. Justin is now firmly in first place for points for, but he'll always be last place in our hearts. He could have easily had even more points if he would have picked the right LA team to play on defense. He had the Rams sitting on his bench with 21 points while the Chargers that he started put up a goose egg. Mike's team had a good week scoring the third most this week, but nothing matters in the face the behemoth known as Justin. The Bengals came back to form for Mike this week with Mixon and Dalton putting healthy but no spectacular numbers. His 2 WR Antonio Brown and Davante Adams both scored over 20. He just needs more from his running backs.
<p><i>Justin has Jono, Brad, and Sak. Not exactly a walk in the park. I hope one of those 3 breaks his huge winning streak.<br/>
  Mike has Mat, Fuki, and Lee. He'll need to beat all 3 to have a chance.
