<h1>Week 6 Recap</h1>
<h2>Matchups:</h2>
 
What a high scoring week. Only 1 team scored under 100 and only 2 teams scored under 118. That means a lot of people's players went off and still disappointed their owners with a loss. Let's see what that looks like in the matchups.

<p><b>Mat vs Sak</b></p><br/>
Just give me the damn trophy already. After scoring the most points last week with 147, I outdid myself and scored the most points with 157 this week. My team is firing on all cylinders except the flex spot, but that's just a product of bye weeks. I shouldn't have that problem barring injuries when we get to the playoffs. I would highlight specific players but I have studs across the board. I will mention Julio Jones because I haven't lost since I traded for him and he's still yet to score a touchdown (most yardage in the league since, but who's counting?) Sak performed admirably after hitting rock bottom a few weeks ago. If his team keeps doing this well, he still has a chance to fight for a low seed playoff spot. Baltimore defense is looking good and they've got a great rest of season schedule. Odell and Alshon are a great WR1+2 pair, he does have some holes in RB but he's betting on D'onta Foreman coming back and taking over the backfield from Lamar Miller. Do know if I'd take that bet.

<p><b>Jono vs Lee</b></p><br/>
Just give Jono the damn trophy already. He wins another taking his season record to 5-1. Though, this was a bit of a lucky win with his team only scoring 118 on the highest scoring week of the year. He would have lost to 7 of the other 9 teams. Not that it matters, a few more wins and he'll lock in a playoff spot. Mahomes is a fucking baller and Gurley is the #1 player in fantasy. Not much more needs to be said about his team. If Dalvin Cook comes back and is back to form, his team will be even more unstoppable. I look forward to facing off with him in the championship. Lee's team is quickly becoming the new taco after a 3 game slide, Keenan Allen is talented but is on too crowded of an offense. David Johnson is talented but on too shitty of an offense. Adrian Petersen is regressing back to 33 year old mean. He really needs Josh Gordon to come save him. With Gordon moving up the WR depth chart in NE, he might actually do that in the second half of the season.

<p><b>Brad vs Fuki</b></p><br/>
After getting whooped by me last week, Brad is back to winning in the closest matchup of the week, he squeaked by with a 2.4 pt win. Sony Michel's emergence and Julian Edelman's return have put Brad's team in a great spot. Harry Butkicker is a great kicker on a great offense and should continue to give him a ton of points rest of season. I appreciate that Brad bet on the Raiders this week starting Jared Cook over Trey Burton, but as Justin says, even his dad (the one and only Elton) is over the Raider's shitty season. We'll have to see if Zeke and Michel are enough RB power for Brad to get through the rest of the season, with Freeman now on IR and Latavius's production being threatened by the return of Dalvin Cook. Fuki needed 10 points from GB defense Monday night to win the matchup and he got close. I see the strategy betting against a back up QB but CJ Beathard actually looked good. Fuki's bet on Jameis Winston keeping up the TB QB production after Fitz seems to be panning out. His CMC is a lot like my Julio with yards but no TDs, so he'll probably win the championship.

<p><b>Justin vs Dylan</b></p><br/>
Justin gets back to .500 with a solid win over Dylan. He's being carried by Saquon and Tyreek on a weekly basis. Somehow scoring over 134 with more than half his players scoring single digits. This seems to the theme for his team. Roethlisberger actually wins one on the road and gives him much needed QB production. I keep thinking Justin's team isn't that great but then he is hanging in there. Maybe he knows something I don't. Oh Dylan, I'm lowkey rooting for his team ever since our trade. He has won 2/3 since then and he's still .500, so it seems to have worked out for the both of us. There was a bit of tinkering he could have done this week to pull out the W. Sammy Watkins pretty much sealed his fate for him with a 2 pt performance in a 83 point shoot out. Tyreek soaked up all the points on Justin's team instead.

<p><b>Brent vs Mike</b></p><br/>
Holy moly, Mike went off this week for 154 points, wasted winning against Brent's meager 98 points. 2 of the 3 tacos from our last power rankings are now .500. Mike got double digits from every single player he started. Mason Crosby bounces back from a 1-4 kicking week with 17 points. Tevin Coleman is now a bonafide RB1 with Freeman going on IR. OJ Howard is back with a vengeance after his injury. Mike smartly did not start Crowell to chase points after his 200+ yard game last week. He literally made all the right decisions this week, there is no configuration of his bench and starters that would have netted him more points. Mike's team is starting to look solid, let's see if he can keep it up next week against the dark horse Dylan, The Battle of the Former Tacos. Brent's team was majorly impacted by the Saints bye week. Losing his top two RBs. Amari Cooper was murdered for a 5 yard gain this week and gave Brent a goose egg. Have I mentioned how bad the Raiders are? I have no confidence playing any Raider player this season. Brent will bounce back next week with the Saints RBs and Golloday's return.
