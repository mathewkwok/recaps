<h1>Week 10 Recap</h1>
<h2>Matchups</h2>
 
<p>What a wild week. 8 out of 10 teams scored over 120. Which means lots of people who did well and still lost. Womp womp.

<p><b>Jono (8-2) 128.56 vs Brad (6-4) 123.84</b></p>
Jono continues his winning ways. Todd Gurley bounces back from a pitiful 16 point performance the week before to post a respectable 23 points (but seriously fuck this guy). Jono strategically went out and picked up MVS last minute to plug in at flex, who ended up getting him a whooping 0.8 points more than the next best bench player. So strategic. We'll finally see Jono at full power next week with Dalvin Cook back to pair with Gurley. He'll have one of the best RB combos in the league. Brad barely lost this one. No one would have predicted that TEN would shit on NE and make Sony Michel useless in his return. He can take solace in knowing that there was nothing he could have done differently to win this one. He left a few points on his bench, but not enough to make a difference. He's hanging onto the 4th seed for the time being as the only 6-4 team. That spot is still anyone's game.

<p><b>Sak (3-7) 143.4 vs Mike (4-6) 77.12</b></p>
Sak finally wins one in the Chubb era. Nick Chubb puts up a ridiculous 34.4 behind a 176/1 performance and breaks the Browns' longest run record while he was at it. The return of Fournette also proved to be everything Sak could have hoped for. Unfortunately he loses Kupp to a season ending ACL injury. He doesn't have much on his bench to fill that spot, Calvin Ridley will have to do. I don't think that'll be enough to get him into the playoffs, but Sak is now in great position to play spoiler for a few 4th seed hopefuls. Mike's team has returned to sucking. Last week I talked about how the Bengal's bye really affected Mike's team, this week it's the return of the Bengals players that tanked his team. Dalton and Mixon combined for about 17 points. Mike's NYJ def also put up the highest negative score of the season with a sweet -3. Mike can try to play spoiler but I don't think he'll even pull that off. Having said that, he'll probably end up beating me in our week 12 rematch.

<p><b>Justin (7-3) 139.42 vs Brent (4-6) 92.12</b></p>
Justin wins handily this week and puts up just enough points to keep me from taking the "most points for" title. True to form, he has 4 players put up single digits and still goes off for 140. He's finally abandoned his strategy of starting a OAK player. Only fitting seeing how the Raiders have abandoned all semblance of trying to win games. Big Ben throws 5 TDs this week, that's equal to the number of TDs scored by all of Brent's starters. That should tell you all you need to know about this matchup. Brent left close to 70 points on the bench and could have won had he made the right decisions, but that's probably asking too much. He'll need to do that next week to stay in the running, but he'll be facing me.

<p><b>Mat (7-3) 150.86 vs Lee (3-7) 123.92</b></p>
I continue to put up big points and clobber Lee this week. David Johnson came back in a big way for Lee. The change in play calling seems to be a huge boon for DJ. Maybe he can finally provide Lee with the first round value that he was projected to have. Keenan Allen and Josh Gordon do just enough to be fantasy relevant but not enough to help Lee win. All his players continue to be mediocre, which is not enough to win in this league where every team is stacked. Lee streamed NE def against TEN, something I also did in 2 of my other leagues, and got jack shit out of it. Why are the Bills and Titans doing well? Things on my side looked pretty much the same as they did the last 3-4 weeks. Julio, Michael Thomas, Conner, and Gordon are bonafide studs and it shows. My biggest problem is choosing the right ones to start.

<p><b>Fuki (3-7) 129.04 vs Dylan (5-5) 152.9</b></p>
Dylan beats Fuki handily with the most points scored this week. As an Eagles fan, it was only fitting that Ertz carried Dylan's team to victory with 33.5 points. After Monday, Dylan might want to consider being a 49ers fan instead. He went into MNF needing about 13 points to win, Breida says fuck that and gave him 26. Adding to the list of random players popping off, Allen Robinson also pitched in 28 points. Dylan is back to .500 and has a cake schedule rest of season: Brad (semi-cake), Lee, Sak, Brent. He might still be able to sneak into the playoffs. Poor Fuki now has more "points for" than 1st place Jono. He just keeps getting matched up with high scoring teams. He will be playing spoiler with Sak for the rest of the season. He does have a chance of clawing his way back in if he wins out. But even then he'd only be at .500. Maybe if he stopped trolling with TB QBs, he'd turn things around.
